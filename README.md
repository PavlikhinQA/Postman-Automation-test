# Dear Friends!
---
### In this repository, I would like to provide my portfolio on automated API testing in Postman.

I got the API from the site [The Movie Database (TMDB)](https://www.themoviedb.org/)
After analyzing all the [API documentation](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started/introduction) on this site, I decided to do some automated tests for checking correct response. I create four blocks with requests. Below you can see the description of the steps of it. The codes, screenshots and explaining of requests and response you can find in separate folders in this repository. In these folders, you can find some created function on JS in pre-request or in Test request. I will be glad if you can give me some feedback. I hope you will enjoy
