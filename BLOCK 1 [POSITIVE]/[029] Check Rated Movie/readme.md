In this GET request, we will find a list of all movies with rates and will check that for movie5Id will be rate 7.5, as created variable in previous step, also that only one rated movie.

In Query Params we need __{{apiKey}}__, __{{sessionId}}__, and in the Path __{{account_id}}__.

__Test code below:__
``` js {.line-numbers}
pm.test("Status code is 200", function () {
    pm.response.to.have.status(200);
});

const response = pm.response.json();
var jsonData = pm.response.json();

pm.test("Checked that movie â„– " + + pm.globals.replaceIn("{{movie5Id}}") + " has been rated", function () {
    var jsonData = pm.response.json();
    pm.expect(jsonData.results[0].id).to.eql(parseInt(pm.globals.get("movie5Id")));
});

pm.test("Only one movie in total results", function () {
    var jsonData = pm.response.json();
    pm.expect(jsonData.total_results).to.eql(1);
});
```

In above code we are checking:

Response of status code must be 200, checking that exactly movie 5 was rated and that only one movie with rate.

Therefore, after pushing Send, we receive body response:
