In Query Params we need __{{apiKey}}__, __{{sessionId}}__, and in the Path __{{account_id}}__.

__Test code below:__

pm.test("Status code is 200", function () {
    pm.response.to.have.status(200);
});

const response = pm.response.json();
var jsonData = pm.response.json();

pm.test("Checked that TV Show â„– " + pm.globals.replaceIn("{{tv2Id}}") + " has been rated", function () {
    var jsonData = pm.response.json();
    pm.expect(jsonData.results[0].id).to.eql(parseInt(pm.globals.get("tv2Id")));
